# 3D-mapping-and-object-segmentation
Indoor navigation for robots has become a crucial part of their use in such environments. Mapping an environment allows autonomous navigation to detect and avoid obstacles. We carry out experiments to establish a baseline for our method. We present our findings and provide avenues for future work.
