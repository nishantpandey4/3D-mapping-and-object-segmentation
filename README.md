### 3D-mapping-and-object-segmentation
Indoor navigation for robots has become a crucial part of their use in such environments. Mapping an environment allows autonomous navigation to detect and avoid obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes RGB images to segment indoor environments. The paper introduces a method for indoor mapping that can be used for robot navigation by first creating a 3D mesh from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) RGB images and then converting this mesh into a point cloud for environmental segmentation. We carry out experiments to establish a baseline for our method. We present our findings and provide avenues for future work.
